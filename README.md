üëã Welcome all Devs!
This project contains the foundation for H√òP - A Discord Alternative, created by Asterisk.

App Live Version: H√òP: Social App

I‚Äôve created this application to address the ongoing concerns with Discord's increasing costs, questionable user privacy practices, and overall management. If you believe in making a change, and you have the power, then you have the obligation to do so.

That's why I, Asterisk, have started to further develop H√òP. I‚Äôve already made a very simple yet crude proof of Concept Web Version which I am now re-writing as a real-deal fullstack application.

üê∏ Support Cape Rain Frogs and Other Causes
Our Commitment
H√òP Social is deeply committed to making the world a better place. As part of our fundraising goals:

20% of our first million dollars raised will go directly towards saving the planet's frog species, starting with the Cape Rain Frog.

The second million will allocate 20% to conserving lizards and snakes.

The third million will allocate 20% to ducks and geese conservation.

The fourth million will allocate 20% towards combating poverty and improving underprivileged areas to better humanity.

For every subsequent million, 20% will be allocated to meaningful causes.

By using H√òP, you are not only connecting with friends and communities but also supporting life-saving initiatives globally.

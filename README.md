# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome all Dev's!
This project contains the foundation for **HÃ˜P** - A Discord Alternative, created by **Asterisk**.

Iâ€™ve created this browser-based application to address the ongoing concerns with Discord's increasing costs, questionable user privacy practices, and overall management. If you believe in making a change, you have the powerâ€”and the obligationâ€”to do so. That's why I, **Asterisk**, have developed **HOP**.

## Key Features

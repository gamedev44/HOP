# üëã Welcome all Devs!

This project contains the foundation for **H√òP** - A Discord Alternative, created by **Asterisk**.

I‚Äôve created this application to address the ongoing concerns with Discord's increasing costs, questionable user privacy practices, and overall management. If you believe in making a change, and you have the power, then you have the obligation to do so. 

That's why I, **Asterisk**, have started to further develop **H√òP**. I‚Äôve already made a very simple yet crude proof of [Concept Web Version](https://hop-socialize.w3spaces.com/) which I am now re-writing as a real-deal fullstack application.

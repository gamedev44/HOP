# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome all Dev's!
This project contains the full foundation for **HÃ˜P** - A Discord Alternative. This aims to be an all-new social platform created by: Asterisk.

I've created this browser-based application to address the ongoing concerns with Discord's increasing costs, questionable user privacy practices, and overall management.

If you believe in making a change, you have the powerâ€”and the obligationâ€”to do so.

That's why I, **Asterisk**, have started to develop HOP further and take it from [proof of concept website](https://hop-socialize.w3spaces.com/) and make it into a full-fledged social platform capable of challenging the likes of Discord, Slack, Element, and others.

## Join me today in making a social difference and let's hop right into the development.

This is a [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), utilizing [Tailwind], [React], [Socket.io], [Prisma], & [MySQL].

## Ready to Start Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project by default uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
# Note: in place of Inter, I have used Open_Sans.
